------------------
* implemented "overlap" concept for automated runs
* select existing users from db when writing an experiment
* record diode output (heat_power) and response (temp) for each analysis
* when diode enabled scan pyrometer and display colormapped indicator for temperature
* measure baselines between peak hops. can explicitly define a peak hop as a baseline.
