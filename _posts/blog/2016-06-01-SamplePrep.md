<!--========================== Blog =========================-->

I recently added two new tasks to the Entry plugin: 1) Sample, for the initial entry of samples and 2) Sample Prep.

Sample is pretty straight forward. It provides ComboBox fields for Principal Investigator, Project, Material and Sample.

An additional field was added to Material, grainsize. So material names such as San 25-32mesh are no longer necessary.

Sample Prep is a glorified lab note book. Its organized by Session and Worker. Session is a simple way of group a set of samples.
Worker is the person assigned to work on set of sample.
