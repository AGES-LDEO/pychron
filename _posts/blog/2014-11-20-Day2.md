<!--========================== Blog =========================-->
This is day 2 of daily blogging. Installed ``pyview_dev1`` onto jan yesterday. There are
now three working repositories on Jan, ``pychron``, ``pychron_2.0.5`` and ``pychron_dev``.
The ``pychron`` dir is checked out at branch ``v2.0.4`` and should be used for ``v2.0.4`` hotfixes.
``pychron_2.0.5`` is the current release and requires testing. A dock version of ``v2.0.5``
will not be made until some initial testing has been performed. 

<div class="note"> 
<p class="note-title">Note</p> <p>Remember to notify everyone about the dock version upgrade when it
happens. <code>pychron_dev</code> is also available and checked out on the <code>develop</code> branch. Use
<code>pychron_dev</code> for <code>pyview</code> fixes and changes  for <code>v2.0.6</code>. </p> 
</div>

There is also now unique \"Pychron\" folders for each version. Remember this is not hardcoded
but simple each version\'s preferences points to a different \"Pychron\" directory. ``pyview_dev1``
is using ``~/PyView_dev``, ``pychron_dev/pyexperiment_dev`` is set to use``~/Pychron_dev`` and
``pyexperiment_2.0.4rc..`` is hardcoded to use  ``~/Pychrondata_dev``.
Use ``Preferences>General>Pychron Root`` to set which \"Pychron\" directory to use.
