<!--========================== Blog =========================-->
This is day 2 of daily blogging. Installed ``pyview_dev1`` onto jan yesterday. There are
now three working repositories on Jan, ``pychron``, ``pychron_2.0.5`` and ``pychron_dev``.
The pychron dir is checked out at branch v2.0.4 and should be used for ``v2.0.4`` hotfixes.
``pychron_2.0.5`` is the current release and requires testing. A dock version of ``v2.0.5``
will not be made until some initial testing has been performed. Remember to notify
everyone about the dock version upgrade when it happens. ``pychron_dev`` is also available and
checked out on the ``develop``. Use ``pychron_dev`` for ``pyview`` fixes and changes for``v2.0.6``.

There is also now unique "Pychron" folders for each version. Remember this is not hardcoded
but simple each version's preferences points to a different "Pychron" directory. ``pyview_dev1``
is using ``~/PyView_dev``, ``pychron_dev/pyexperiment_dev`` is set to use``~/Pychron_dev`` and
``pyexperiment_2.0.4rc..`` is hardcoded to use  ``~/Pychrondata_dev``.
Use ``Preferences>General>Pychron Root`` to set which "Pychron" directory to use.
